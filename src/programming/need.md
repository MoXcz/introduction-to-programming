# Why Are Programs Needed?

If we get a little philosophical, *programs aren't really needed*—but like most philosophical intricacies, that line of thought isn’t all that helpful in practice. So, why *are* programs needed? Simply put: because people want them.

At their core, programs help solve problems—whether it's something humans can't do (like decrypting complex messages), or something they just don’t *want* to do (like performing mathematical operations).

There’s also this: many programs exist simply because people *enjoy* creating them. We're at a point where *programming* has become a creative discipline—arguably a form of art in its own right.

Of course, there’s also the less romantic reason: money. People write programs to get paid. What could be more motivating?

But seriously—programs exist to solve problems. That’s their fundamental purpose. Although, as mentioned earlier, some programs today seem to create more problems than they solve—intentionally or not.

I’m not going to dive into the state of the software industry—partly because I’m not in a position to make grand claims, and partly because that’s not the point. Programming is, at its heart, about *expressing* an idea and *finding a solution*.

If your reason for learning programming is money, that’s totally valid. There are still plenty of opportunities out there—even with the constant wave of new LLMs supposedly replacing programmers.
