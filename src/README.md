# Introduction

This is a book about programming. Rust will primarily serve as a *tool* to explain the concepts—this is not a book about learning Rust itself. For that, read [*The Book*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

> Whether using Rust as the language to teach programming is debatable—but it's my book, so I will use it.

The book aims to give an overview of what programming is and *how to do it*. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide, so I will intentionally skip some finer details, even at the risk of oversimplifying or leaving certain things unexplained.

The general planned outline of the book is as follows:

- Introduction to [Programs and Programming](programming/index.html)
- An introduction to the [Rust](rust/index.html) programming language
- More on [Data Types and Memory](memory/index.html)
- [Programs that do things](programs/index.html)
