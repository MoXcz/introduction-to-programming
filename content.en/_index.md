# Introduction to Programming

This is a book about programming. Go will primarily serve as a *tool* to explain the conceptsâ€”this is not a book about learning Go itself. For that, there are a lot of great resources (see [resources](resources/))

The book aims to give an overview of what programming is and *how to do it*. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide, so I will intentionally skip some finer details, even at the risk of oversimplifying or leaving certain things unexplained.

The general planned outline of the book is as follows:

- Introduction to [Programs and Programming](programming/)
- Basic introduction to the [Golang](go/) programming language
- More on [Data Types and Memory](memory/)
- [Programs that do things](programs/)

[> Next](/programming/)
